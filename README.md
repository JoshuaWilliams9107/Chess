# Chess Program
A lightweight chess game created in the .NET Framework.

## - About the Project -
This Chess Program is a tech demo showcasing and testing primarily what I learned about encapsulation and seperation of concerns from my Software Engineering course.  I attempted to create a chess program early into my software developement studies in high school after teaching myself some of the .NET framework, however, the code for the program was all written in one file.  It was an absolute mess. With this I attempted to rewrite that program to be more efficient, more modular, and easier to update.  Furthermore, I decided to design every algorithm needed for each chess problem myself to practice my problem-solving skills.
